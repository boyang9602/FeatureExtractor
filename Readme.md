# FeatureExtractor

Extract code features from source code files. Need to specify data root path for main. data sturcture please refer to [RefactoringDetector](https://github.com/boyang9602/RefactoringDetector)  
Currently it is a basic framework. In the RefInfoHandler's instance, you can get the source class content, which is the whole class's content in String.   
dependency management uses maven

#### TODOs:  
1. specify what features are needed.  
2. specify data format for code feature.  
3. write a visitor to extract the code feature.
